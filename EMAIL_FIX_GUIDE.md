# Email Verification Fix Guide

## Issue Fixed: "Can't send verification link" error

### What was wrong:
1. Missing email credentials in .env file
2. Email service error handling was too strict
3. No fallback for development/testing

### Quick Fix Applied:

#### 1. Updated .env file
Added email configuration section:
```
# Email Configuration (Required for verification emails)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

#### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages for users
- Graceful fallback when email services fail
- Demo mode shows verification code in console for testing

#### 3. Added Development Mode
- When running on localhost, verification codes are shown in browser console
- No need to configure email for testing

### To Use Email Service:

#### Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended)
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate an App Password for Gmail
4. Update .env file:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=youremail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-digit-app-password
   ```

#### Option 2: Demo Mode (For Testing)
- Just run the app on localhost
- Verification codes will appear in browser console
- No email setup needed

### Running the Application:

#### Start both servers:
```bash
npm run start-all
```

#### Or start individually:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Main server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Email server  
npm run email
```

### Verification Process Now:
1. âœ… User signs up
2. âœ… System tries to send email via backend service
3. âœ… If backend fails, tries EmailJS
4. âœ… If both fail, shows code in console (localhost only)
5. âœ… User can still verify and continue

### Status: 
ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - Email verification now works with proper fallbacks
